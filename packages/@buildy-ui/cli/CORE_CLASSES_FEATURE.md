# 📦 Core Classes Feature

## Overview

The CLI now automatically handles `core-classes.json` - a configuration file that lists all Tailwind CSS classes used by components in the registry.

This file is:
1. **Copied during build** from project source to registry distribution
2. **Downloaded during init** and installed to user projects automatically
3. **Used for Tailwind safelist** to prevent class purging

---

## Build Process

### What Happens

During `npm run build`, the CLI:

1. ✅ Processes all components and builds registry
2. ✅ **Copies** `src/lib/core-classes.json` → `packages/registry/r/ui/lib/core-classes.json`
3. ✅ Generates schema files
4. ✅ Creates index.json with component metadata

### Example

```bash
# Source file (in your project)
src/lib/core-classes.json

# After build, copies to:
packages/registry/r/ui/lib/core-classes.json
```

### Implementation

In `src/commands/build.ts`:

```typescript
// Copy core-classes.json to registry if it exists
await copyCoreClassesFile(buildOptions)

async function copyCoreClassesFile(buildOptions: BuildOptions) {
  const sourceFile = path.join(buildOptions.cwd, "src/lib/core-classes.json")
  const libDir = path.join(buildOptions.outputDir, "lib")
  const targetFile = path.join(libDir, "core-classes.json")
  
  try {
    if (await fs.pathExists(sourceFile)) {
      await fs.ensureDir(libDir)
      await fs.copy(sourceFile, targetFile)
      console.log(chalk.gray(`   📄 Copied core-classes.json to lib/`))
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(chalk.yellow(`   ⚠️  Could not copy core-classes.json: ${(error as Error).message}`))
  }
}
```

---

## Installation Process

### What Happens

During `npx buildy-ui init`, the CLI:

1. ✅ Creates project directory structure
2. ✅ **Downloads** `core-classes.json` from registry CDN
3. ✅ **Installs** to `@/lib/core-classes.json` in the project
4. ✅ Graceful fallback if file not available (optional)

### Example

```bash
# After init, installed to:
src/lib/core-classes.json

# Can be used in tailwind.config.js for safelist
```

### Implementation

In `src/commands/init.ts`:

```typescript
async function installCoreClasses(registryType: string, libDir: string, spinner: ora.Ora) {
  try {
    const cdnUrls = getCdnUrls(registryType as any)
    let downloaded = false
    let lastError: Error | null = null
    
    for (const baseUrl of cdnUrls) {
      try {
        const url = `${baseUrl}/lib/core-classes.json`
        const response = await fetch(url)
        
        if (response.ok) {
          const content = await response.text()
          const libPath = path.join(process.cwd(), libDir)
          await fs.ensureDir(libPath)
          await fs.writeFile(path.join(libPath, "core-classes.json"), content, "utf-8")
          downloaded = true
          break
        }
      } catch (error) {
        lastError = error as Error
        continue
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Gracefully handle failure - core-classes.json is optional
    spinner.text = `⚠️  Skipped core utilities installation (optional)`
  }
}
```

## File Format

### core-classes.json

```json
{
  "classes": [
    "text-xs",
    "text-sm",
    "text-base",
    "text-lg",
    "text-xl",
    "bg-white",
    "bg-slate-50",
    "rounded-md",
    "rounded-lg",
    "border",
    "border-slate-200",
    "shadow-sm",
    "shadow-md"
  ],
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Using in Tailwind Config

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
import { readFileSync } from "fs"
import { join } from "path"

// Load core component classes
const coreClassesPath = join(process.cwd(), "src/lib/core-classes.json")
const coreClasses = JSON.parse(readFileSync(coreClassesPath, "utf-8")).classes

export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
  // Safelist core component classes to prevent purging
  safelist: [...coreClasses],
}
```

---

## Workflow

### For Library Authors

```bash
# 1. Create core-classes.json in your project
cat > src/lib/core-classes.json << 'EOF'
{
  "classes": ["text-xs", "text-sm", "bg-white", "rounded-md"],
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
EOF

# 2. Build registry (core-classes.json is copied automatically)
npx buildy-ui build ./src/registry.json --output ./packages/registry/r/ui

# 3. Deploy to CDN
# packages/registry/r/ui/lib/core-classes.json is now available
```

### For Users

```bash
# 1. Initialize project (core-classes.json is downloaded automatically)
npx buildy-ui init

# Output:
# ✅ Created src/ directories
# ✅ Installed core utilities
# ✅ Setup complete!

# 2. core-classes.json is now in src/lib/core-classes.json
# 3. Use in tailwind.config.js as shown above
```

## Error Handling

### Build Time

If `src/lib/core-classes.json` doesn't exist:
- ✅ Build continues normally
- ⚠️ Message: "Copied core-classes.json to lib/" (if found)
- 📝 No error, just skipped

### Init Time

If `core-classes.json` can't be downloaded:
- ✅ Init continues normally
- ⚠️ Message: "Skipped core utilities installation (optional)"
- 📝 No error, just skipped
- 💡 Users can add it manually if needed

---

- ✅ Works out of the box
- ✅ Optional (won't break if missing)

---

## Technical Details

### Build Operation

1. Source: `src/lib/core-classes.json`
2. Operation: `fs.copy(source, target)`
3. Target: `packages/registry/r/ui/lib/core-classes.json`
4. Timing: After components are processed
5. Error Handling: Graceful (optional file)

### Init Operation

1. Fetch from: CDN URLs from `getCdnUrls()`
2. Path: `${baseUrl}/lib/core-classes.json`
3. Target: `src/lib/core-classes.json`
4. Timing: After directories are created
5. Error Handling: Graceful (optional file)

### Retry Logic

- ✅ Tries all CDN URLs in order
- ✅ Stops on first success
- ✅ Continues if all fail (optional)
- ✅ No blocking errors
